<h1> The Autophile </h1>

<h3> Defination of Autophile</h3>
<p> A person who loves solitude. Well, being an autophile is fun. They are intoverts who love being alone. </p>

<h1> Something about autophile </h1>
<p> Technically speaking it's not a man who has intract with cars. As I'm one such I know my subject. An autophile is in love with him or herself. So I'm stuffed for a good word to use (apart from the often heard, insane, crazy, etc). The only alternative I've heard is automobiliphilia. Quite a mouthful, more than the gearknob of a Jaguar XJ8 so probably won't be popular. There probably should be two words. One for a person who loves his car on every level and has it as a substitute totally for a human partner and one for a man who simply loves it. </p>

Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>

The point of using Loibution of letters, <br> as opposed to using <br> 'Corem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distrntent here,<br> content here', making it look like readable English. <br> Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy.

only the redeeming light on
the shoulders dancing in
tall weeds, cigarettes gone
